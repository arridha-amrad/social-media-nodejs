FIRST STEP
===========
A request is sent to profile update
	this what the url will look like
		http://localhost:3000/profile/userId395894359623

When there is userId in the incoming request(url)
	based on that userId
		our backend will make a query to database and load the user information(name, email, etc)
			like so: req.profile = userInformation


SECOND STEP
===========
add a property called auth in requireSignin()
	so that we know the user is authenticated


THIRD STEP
==========
create hasAuthorization()
	to make sure the req object has
		req.profile && req.auth && req.profile._id === req.auth_id
